 AOT_thaddai_power_couple:0 "Thaddai Power Couple"
 AOT_thaddai_power_couple_desc:0 "The Thaddai family - the Exarchess Kyrene Thaddas, Imperial Representative Nestorius Thaddas, and their son Timon - have been icons of Aotearoa since the formation of the Exarchate. The political advocacy of Kyrene and Nestorius paved the way for not only the reintegration of the islands following the end of the Imperial Civil War of 1910-1913, but also the establishment of the Exarchate in the first place, establishing a proper Romanitist government which cares for all inhabitants of the islands. Though getting on in age now, they remain the burning heart of the fledgling state."
 AOT_thaddai_heartbreak:0 "Thaddai Heartbreak"
 AOT_thaddai_heartbreak_desc:0 "Though the death of Nestorius Thaddas has brought great sadness to the Exarchate, no one has been impacted more by it than our Exarchess herself. Previously tiredly chipper if worried about the future, Kyrene has increasingly become withdrawn from the public eye, with her staff slowly taking on more and more of her responsibilities. The public worries for what will become of the (grand)mother of the nation, though her staff and son Timon reassure all that she's doing fine."
 AOT_trauma_of_black_thursday:0 "Trauma of Black Thursday"
 AOT_trauma_of_black_thursday_desc:0 "Though the economy has long since recovered, the shock of the 1925 Black Thursday stock market crash remains in the collective consciousness. Recent global affairs have many worrying over many aspects of the economy, worry that Black Thursday may come to haunt the Exarchate once more. We must do what we can to overcome the collective trauma the people faced in the state's infancy."
 AOT_staunch_anti_militarists:0 "Staunch Anti-Militarists"
 AOT_staunch_anti_militarists_desc:0 "The Labour Party of Aoteorea has implemented a policy of anti-militarism, holding the belief that change is better accomplished through peaceful means, whether through the market or through political action. The pain of the former Imperial Civil War and the Presidential Dictatorship that ruled the islands then has led to many being in favor of this policy, considering peace to be preferable, and wishing to avoid conflict. How long such a policy may last in the world today, we will soon have to see."
 AOT_thaddai_hope:0 "Thaddai Hope"
 AOT_thaddai_hope_desc:0 "With the passing of the founding couple of Aoteorea, only one Thaddai remains in this world - their son, Timon Thaddas. The Exarchate had, to some degree, watched him grow from strength to strength, as it became his home in body and mind. For many, Timon represents a burning candle flame in treacherous winds. Now both state and he stand young and timid in a changing world, but there remains hope that these are mere bumps on the long road ahead. The flame of Aoteorea burns brightly still."
 AOT_timon_thaddas:0 "Timon Thaddas"
 AOT_timon_abroad_desc:0 "Timon is abroad representing the interests of not just the Thaddai family, but of all of Aoteorea. Though his connection to his birthplace may be weak in favor of the islands, and he may be timid, he will do what he can for what he considers his home."
 AOT_timon_at_home_desc:0 "Timon is presently in Aoteorea, forced into a public position following recent affairs. Though timid, his every action speaks to the love he has for the islands and the care he has for his fellow countrymen, reassuring the young and old alike."

 tesb_AOT.2.d:0 "At around the age of 87, surrounded by friends and family, the Imperial Representative for Aoteorea (and Technical Exarch) Nestorius Thaddas passed away.
