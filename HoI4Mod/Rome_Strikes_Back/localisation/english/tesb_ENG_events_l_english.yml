 tesb_england.1.d:0 "The Pindoraman Liberation Party has declared their victory in the current election. They have promised to completely overhaul the country and establish a republican form of government. "
 tesb_england.1.a:0 "This is concerning."
 tesb_england.1000.t:0 "The Republic of Pindorama Declared"
 tesb_england.1000.d:0 "England's war with Tawantinsuyu was extremely unpopular among the people of the kingdom. Not only had it stalemated for years before a final breakthrough, but thousands of English, many of them indigenous Pindoramans, had been killed or injured. This further radicalized England's communist organizations, which were opposed to the war and saw it as a pet project of a colonial monarchy.\n\nIn Georgeham, the leading socialist, communist, and nationalist factions formed an alliance, the Pindoraman Liberation Party, committed to overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a republic. They gained massive support from a war-weary populace which had lost much and gained little from the war and now blamed the monarchy and English upper class. As a result, the English parliamentary elections this hear led to a landslide victory for the PLP. A day later, anti-monarchy protests paralyzed the capital of Charles' Landing. When the army was sent in to break them up, the troops instead sided with the protesters and marched on Saint George's Palace.\n\nOn the advice of his cabinet, King Thomas I fled the city and with his supporters went into exile in the English colony of New Cornwall. After storming the now vacated palace, the PLP's leader [ENG.GetCommunistLeader] appeared on the main balcony and proclaimed, to cheering crowds, the establishment of the Republic of Pindorama."
 tesb_england.1000.a:0 "This is concerning."
 tesb_england.2.t:0 "Fate of the English"
 tesb_england.2.d:0 "English settlers in Pindorama no longer control the country, what shall we do with them?"
 tesb_england.2.a:0 "Exile them, they can return to Europe"
 tesb_england.2.b:0 "Integrate them, they can live here"
 tesb_england.3.t:0 "English Expelled from Pindorama"
 tesb_england.3.d:0 "The Pindoraman Liberation Party that has recently taken control of England, now known as Pindorama, has continued its aggressive decolonization and equalization efforts. Not satisfied with the exile of Thomas I, the radicals controlling the party have now ordered the expulsion of all English from Pindorama and the seizure of their assets for their centuries of crimes against the Pindoraman people.\n\nAlready thousands of English have been forced onto old cargo ships and sent across the Atlantic to Europe. Many more will soon follow. Despite condemnation from many nations on both sides of the Atlantic, the PLP shows no signs of reversing this policy. As a result, many European governments have begun bracing for an incoming refugee crisis, the likes of which the world has never seen before."
 tesb_england.3.a:0 "There is no place for them here"
 tesb_england.3.b:0 "Of course we'll grant their request"
 tesb_england.4.t:0 "The Third International Declared (Again)"
 tesb_england.4.desc:0 "The Republic of Pindorama has completed its internal stabilization. All remnants of the old English order have been either destroyed, exiled to New Cornwall, or driven into the wilderness of the Amazon rainforest. Just as happened in Iraq decades ago, communism has firmly rooted itself in what was once England. Now, Pindorama looks outward once again. [ENG.GetLeader] has declared the reformation of the International, declaring Pindorama the rightful inheritor of the legacy and mission of the Second International. He condemned the other rival Third Internationals as failures and illegitimate pretenders, calling on all true leftists to join Pindorama instead."
