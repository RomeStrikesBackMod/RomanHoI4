 tesb_england.1000.t:0 "The Republic of Pindorama Declared"
 tesb_england.1000.d:0 "England's war with Tawantinsuyu was extremely unpopular among the people of the kingdom. Not only had it stalemated for years before a final breakthrough, but thousands of English, many of them indigenous Pindoramans, had been killed or injured. This further radicalized England's communist organizations, which were opposed to the war and saw it as a pet project of a colonial monarchy.\n\nIn Georgeham, the leading socialist, communist, and nationalist factions formed an alliance, the Pindoraman Liberation Party, committed to overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a republic. They gained massive support from a war-weary populace which had lost much and gained little from the war and now blamed the monarchy and English upper class. As a result, the English parliamentary elections this hear led to a landslide victory for the PLP. A day later, anti-monarchy protests paralyzed the capital of Charles' Landing. When the army was sent in to break them up, the troops instead sided with the protesters and marched on Saint George's Palace.\n\nOn the advice of his cabinet, King Thomas I fled the city and with his supporters went into exile in the English colony of New Cornwall. After storming the now vacated palace, the PLP's leader [ENG.GetCommunistLeader] appeared on the main balcony and proclaimed, to cheering crowds, the establishment of the Republic of Pindorama."
