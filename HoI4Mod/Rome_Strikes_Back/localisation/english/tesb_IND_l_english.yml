 tesb_india.2.t:0 "Hindustan Announces Mandala Democratic League"
 tesb_india.2.desc:0 "It appears that the Empire of Hindustan, after spending the last two years presiding over internal reforms, is once again looking outward. Badshah Ventkatadri I and Peshwa Uyyalawada Kattabomman have long been known as patrons of democratic movements within India, and now they seek to extend that patronization overseas. In a speech earlier today, Ventkatadri I announced the formation of the Mandala Democratic League, a military and economic bloc founded on common principles of democracy and human rights. Many democratic nations on the Indian Ocean have already signaled their willingness to begin negotiations, while democratic organizations in non-democratic nations in Southeast Asia have surged in membership and morale, concerning Zhu Wei and the architects of his GACPS."
 tesb_india.2.a:0 "Another pillar of democracy arises in the east."
