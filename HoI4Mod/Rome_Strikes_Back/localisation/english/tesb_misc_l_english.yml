 van_election.2.t:0 "Election: Public Opposes Rearmament"
 van_election.2.d:0 "In the upcoming election, support for [Root.GetRulingParty] is still high, the people having confidence in [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership. However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Cooperating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."
 van_election.2.a:0 "The people must be heard."
 van_election.2.b:0 "Protecting our sovereignty comes first."
 van_election.3.t:0 "Election: Absolutists in Government?"
 van_election.3.d:0 "An aggressively monarchist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting absolutist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."

One of these in particular has won favor in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to cooperate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."

 van_election.4.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 van_election.5.t:0 "Election: Communists in Government?"
 van_election.5.d:0 "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fueled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through cooperating with the government rather than overthrowing it."
 van_election.5.a:0 "Rather reform than revolution!"
 van_election.5.b:0 "A broad coalition of democratic parties is preferable."
 van_election.6.t:0 "Election: Democratic Parties in Minority"
 van_election.6.d:0 "Politics in [Root.GetName] have grown increasingly radicalized. Where there was once broad support for the parties which supported democratic ideals and [Root.GetName]'s representative institutions, more voters have turned to the political extremes in this van_election. The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority. To avoid a weak minority government, we have no choice but to cooperate with either fascists or communists."

 van_election.7.t:0 "Fascists Influence Foreign Policy"
 van_election.7.d:1 "Accepting the fascists into our political coalition has had an impact on our foreign policy. Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathizers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."
 van_election.7.a:0 "We can use some allies against greater threats."
 van_election.7.b:0 "With friends like that, we'd need no enemies."
 van_election.8.t:0 "Communists Influence Foreign Policy"
 van_election.8.d:0 "Communists often consider themselves to be part of an international revolution, and our choice to accept them as partners in our government has drawn the attention of many of their international allies. Representatives of communist parties maintain close ties to nations which have abandoned our form of government in favor of a dictatorship of the proletariat, ties which we may need to acknowledge in [Root.GetAdjective] foreign policy if we wish to retain their support."
 van_election.8.a:0 "We should embrace our common causes."
 van_election.8.b:0 "Down that path lies the dissolution of [Root.GetName] itself."

 van_election.10.t:0 "Election: Absolutist Majority"
 van_election.10.d:0 "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of an absolutist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic monarch. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."
 van_election.10.a:0 "It is a black day for [Root.GetName], but the people have spoken."

 van_election.11.b:0 "We will not give up our liberty without a fight!"
 van_election.12.t:0 "Election: Communist Majority"
 van_election.12.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the communist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."
 van_election.12.a:0 "This is troubling, but they truly do represent the majority."
 van_election.12.b:0 "We must stop them before they abolish every sign of dissenting thought!"
 van_election.13.t:0 "Election: Magnate Favors Fascism"
 van_election.13.d:0 "An influential industrialist behind one of the companies we have chosen to work with for our industrial production has recently made a number of statements on politics that members of the administration found troubling. He has openly advocated an authoritarian government and praised foreign administrations that identify as fascist, implicitly suggesting that [Root.GetName] would benefit from such rulership. Denouncing the magnate and his ideals might sour our relationship with the company, but leaving them unchecked would give him a platform for spreading propaganda that erodes all that [Root.GetRulingParty] stands for."
 van_election.13.a:0 "He can say what he pleases, we need not endorse it."
 van_election.13.b:0 "We cannot rely on fascists to develop and protect [Root.GetName]."
 van_election.14.t:0 "Election: Wartime Exception"
 van_election.14.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is in a state of war. Normally, an election would be held at this time, but being in the midst of an important conflict many argue that cannot afford to spend time on political campaigning, or a change of leadership if that should come about. Meanwhile, others claim that declaring the ongoing war a valid reason for skipping elections is the first step towards eroding [Root.GetAdjective] democracy. After all, letting military matters take precedence over the people's influence could be a slippery slope."
 van_election.14.a:0 "Elections will be held as usual."
 van_election.14.b:0 "We can take care of such matters when this war is through."
 van_election.15.t:0 "Election: Government Contested"
 van_election.15.d:0 "With an upcoming election, people are beginning to question the capability of the current administration to pursue the ongoing war. [Root.GetName] has suffered greatly and popular opinion has turned against those who seem to be leading our nation to defeat. While our people are determined to see the war to the end, they would rather see another government ending it."
 van_election.15.a:0 "This crisis of trust is highly unfortunate."
 van_election.15.b:0 "Let the political landscape shift to keep the people united."
 van_election.16.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Enjoys Public Support"
 van_election.16.d:0 "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticized the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 van_election.16.a:0 "One people, one leader."
 van_election.17.t:0 "Election Results Questioned"
 van_election.17.d:0 "Although the [Root.GetLeader] regime has strong-armed most of its opponents into silence, some have still spoken out about the recent election, accusing the [Root.GetRulingParty] of rigging the results and ignoring the clear efforts to elect a parliament opposed to their policies.\n\nThe government brushes these objections aside as an effort to divide the people against itself. However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."
 van_election.17.a:0 "Splitters!"
