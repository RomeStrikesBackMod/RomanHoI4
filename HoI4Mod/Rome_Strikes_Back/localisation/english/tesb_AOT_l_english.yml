 AOT_thaddai_power_couple_desc:0 "The Thaddai family - the Exarchess Kyrene Thaddas, Imperial Representative Nestorius Thaddas, and their son Timon - have been icons of Aotearoa since the formation of the Exarchate. The political advocacy of Kyrene and Nestorius paved the way for not only the reintegration of the islands following the end of the Imperial Civil War of 1910-1913, but also the establishment of the Exarchate in the first place, establishing a proper Romanitist government which cares for all inhabitants of the islands. Though getting on in age now, they remain the burning heart of the fledgling state."
 AOT_thaddai_heartbreak:0 "Thaddai Heartbreak"

The pain of the former Imperial Civil War and the Presidential Dictatorship that ruled the islands then has led to many being in favor of this policy, considering peace to be preferable, and wishing to avoid conflict.

The (grand)mother of the nation, the people mourn greatly for her and all she had done for the country since 1910, as an advocate and as a leader.
