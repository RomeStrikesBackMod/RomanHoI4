 AOT_grand_campaign_DESC:0 "The Exarchate of Aotearoa was born in 1915, two years after the Roman Empire liberated Aotearoa from the twisted dictatorship of Tane. The Thaddai family were tasked to be its shepherds, with Kyrene Thaddas heading the local government and her husband Nestorius serving as the Aotearoa's Imperial Representative. Since then, Aotearoa has maintained close ties with the Empire, Kyrene and Nestorius still remain poltically active despite their age, and domestically, economic concerns dominate the discourse, with fears of another stock market crash as had happened in early September 1925. The road ahead is bumpy for Aotearoa."

 AOT_thaddai_power_couple_desc:0 "The Thaddai family - the Exarchess Kyrene Thaddas, Imperial Representative Nestorius Thaddas, and their son Timon - have been icons of Aotearoa since the formation of the Exarchate. The political advocacy of Kyrene and Nestorius paved the way for not only the reintegration of the islands following the end of the Imperial Civil War of 1910-1913, but also the establishment of the Exarchate in the first place, establishing a proper Romanitist government which cares for all inhabitants of the islands. Though getting on in age now, they remain the burning heart of the fledgling state."

The pain of the former Imperial Civil War and the Presidential Dictatorship that ruled the islands then has led to many being in favor of this policy, considering peace to be preferable, and wishing to avoid conflict. How long such a policy may last in the world today, we will soon have to see."

Now both state and he stand young and timid in a changing world, but there remains hope that these are mere bumps on the long road ahead. The flame of Aoteorea burns brightly still."
 AOT_timon_thaddas:0 "Timon Thaddas"
 AOT_timon_abroad_desc:0 "Timon is abroad representing the interests of not just the Thaddai family, but of all of Aoteorea. Though his connection to his birthplace may be weak in favor of the islands, and he may be timid, he will do what he can for what he considers his home."

 AOT_taneist_terror:0 "Taneist Terror"
 AOT_taneist_terror_desc:0 "Treacherous winds have blown out the burning candle that is Aoteorea. With the death of Timon Thaddas, committed by the very group his parents advocated against, the bumps on the long road ahead have turned to chasms. Darkness has come to engulf the islands."

 tesb_AOT.2.d:0 "At around the age of 87, surrounded by friends and family, the Imperial Representative for Aoteorea (and Technical Exarch) Nestorius Thaddas passed away. Emphatic to the core, he would take the reigns as Aotearoa's advocate in his position as Senator, all for the sake of one Māori, the one who now mourns him most. Widely considered the (grand)father of the nation, he will be greatly missed."

 tesb_AOT.5.d:0 "Surrounded by friends and family, Hairini Waata, Kyrene Udata Thaddas upon marriage, has passed away from stress cardiomyopathy, reportedly induced by the passing of her husband. Caring of family and community, it would be her that would inspire Nestorius to take up the reins of Aoteorea's advocate, and her role as his aid would lead to her being awarded by the Emperor himself the position of Exarchess of her homeland, which she humbly accepted. The (grand)mother of the nation, the people mourn greatly for her and all she had done for the country since 1910, as an advocate and as a leader.
