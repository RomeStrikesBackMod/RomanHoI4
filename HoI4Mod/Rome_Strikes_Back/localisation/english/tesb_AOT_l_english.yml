 AOT_thaddai_power_couple_desc:0 "The Thaddai family - the Exarchess Kyrene Thaddas, Imperial Representative Nestorius Thaddas, and their son Timon - have been icons of Aotearoa since the formation of the Exarchate. The political advocacy of Kyrene and Nestorius paved the way for not only the reintegration of the islands following the end of the Imperial Civil War of 1910-1913, but also the establishment of the Exarchate in the first place, establishing a proper Romanitist government which cares for all inhabitants of the islands. Though getting on in age now, they remain the burning heart of the fledgling state."

 AOT_thaddai_heartbreak_desc:0 "Though the death of Nestorius Thaddas has brought great sadness to the Exarchate, no one has been impacted more by it than our Exarchess herself. Previously tiredly chipper if worried about the future, Kyrene has increasingly become withdrawn from the public eye, with her staff slowly taking on more and more of her responsibilities.

The pain of the former Imperial Civil War and the Presidential Dictatorship that ruled the islands then has led to many being in favor of this policy, considering peace to be preferable, and wishing to avoid conflict.

Caring of family and community, it would be her that would inspire Nestorius to take up the reins of Aoteorea's advocate, and her role as his aid would lead to her being awarded by the Emperor himself the position of Exarchess of her homeland, which she humbly accepted. The (grand)mother of the nation, the people mourn greatly for her and all she had done for the country since 1910, as an advocate and as a leader.
