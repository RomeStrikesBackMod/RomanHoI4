 AOT_grand_campaign_DESC:0 "In 1915, two years after liberating Aotearoa from the twisted dictatorship of Tane, the Roman Empire instituted a policy of federation with the islands, permitting it complete autonomy over its internal affairs and some some degree of autonomy over its external diplomacy. The Thaddai family, the political advocates of Aotearoa in the Senate, were tasked to be its shepherds, with Kyrene Thaddas heading the local government, and her husband Nestorius serving as the Imperial Representative to Aotearoa. And so the Exarchate of Aotearoa was born. Since then, it has maintained a close relationship with the Empire. Kyrene and Nestorius remain active despite their age, and economic concerns dominate domestic discourse with fears of the Aotearoan stock market crashing as it had in early September 1925. The road ahead is bumpy for Aotearoa."
