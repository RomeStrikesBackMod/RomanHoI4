 tesb_MEX.1.t:0 "The Return of Anahuaca Democracy"
 tesb_MEX.1.desc:0 "After over a century of dictatorship, the Cipac family has finally been overthrown, and democracy has returned to Anahuac. Representatives from all of the major parties and resistance groups have gathered in Tenochtitlan to begin the hard work of rebuilding a democratic government. Two major factions have emerged as leaders of the movement: the centralist Iakoboi, inspired by New Paphlagonia, and the Longhouseist-federalist alliance, with the backing of New Arcadia."
 tesb_MEX.1.a:0 "The sun will shine on Anahuac once again."
 tesb_MEX.2.t:0 "Anahuaca Iakoboi Ascendant"
 tesb_MEX.2.desc:0 "To the dismay of the federalist factions, the New Paphlagonian-inspired Iakoboi factions have united most of the other groups under their leadership and have now taken center stage in the constitutional convention. Proclaiming the Federal Republic of Anahuac, they insisted that only a strong central leader could protect the nation against the return of the Cipacs."
 tesb_MEX.2.a:0 "A strong leader for a strong Anahuac?"
 MEX_iakobist:0 "Federal Republic of Anahuac"
 tesb_MEX.3.t:0 "Anahuaca Federalists Prevail"
 tesb_MEX.3.desc:0 "The federalist factions, with the help of the Longhouseists, have managed to unite and assert their voice as one, rallying the other groups behind their vision of a renewed federation of altepetls. Much of the old constitution as it was before the Cipacs has been restored, and the Federation of Anahuac lives once again."
 tesb_MEX.3.a:0 "The revolution lives on."
 tesb_MEX.4.t:0 "Second Anahuac Revolution"
 tesb_MEX.4.desc:0 "With democratic institutions firmly in place, it is clear to all that the Anahuac of old has finally returned. The Second Anahuac Revolution that generations of anti-Cipac rebels fought for has finally been achieved. For the first time in over a hundred years, the Anahuaca people are free.\nNow all that remains is to move forward and protect that freedom."
 tesb_MEX.4.a:0 "And may the Cipacs never return!"
 tesb_MEX.5.t:0 "Anahuac Intervenes in the UTA"
 tesb_MEX.5.desc:0 "The long dormant Anahuac jaguar has finally stirred awake, woken by the chaos engulfing its northern neighbor. The democratic UTA had supported Anahuac’s return to democracy, so to see them too fall into separatism and authoritarianism was a shock to many Anahuaca. In a recent vote out before the altepetls, all unanimously voted to intervene in the UTA to restore its democracy, to save the Tsalagi just as they saved the Anahuaca."
 tesb_MEX.5.a:0 "New World democracy will be saved!"
 tesb_MEX.6.t:0 "Anahuac Determines Fate of the English"
 tesb_MEX.6.desc:0 "After the fall of England, the Anahuaca government was left with the question of what to do with the millions of Europeans who now lived within (Pindorama). Ultimately, the hard decision was made to (choice from focus/event option)."
 tesb_MEX.6.a:0 "Concerning."
 tesb_MEX.7.t:0 "Anahuac, Leader of the New World"
 tesb_MEX.7.desc:0 "Although the UTA has now been stabilized, it is clear they are unfit to lead the Turtle Alliance at the moment. Recognizing that, Anahuac has taken up the torch of the turtle and has assumed leadership of the alliance, proclaiming that the liberation of oppressed peoples everywhere was now at hand."
 tesb_MEX.7.a:0 "What do they mean by everywhere?"
 tesb_MEX.8.t:0 "Operation Dawn of Freedom"
 tesb_MEX.8.desc:0 "The Turtle Alliance of Anahuac has declared war on the GACPS and China, declaring that it could no longer tolerate the military authoritarianism of Zhu Wei."
 tesb_MEX.8.a:0 "The jaguar emerges from the dawn to challenge the dragon."
 tesb_MEX.9.t:0 "Anahuac Allies with the Empire"
 tesb_MEX.9.desc:0 "Anahuac has decided to sign a formal alliance between the Turtle Alliance and the Empire and its allies, recognizing their common commitment to democratic ideals."
 tesb_MEX.9.a:0 "The jaguar and eagle work together!"
 tesb_MEX.10.t:0 "Operation Sunset Liberation"
 tesb_MEX.10.desc:0 "Anahuac has decided that the national republican menace, which has perverted the original cause of republicanism in favor of a nationalistic and totalitarian goal, is too great to ignore. To that end, the altepetls have voted to declare war on the (fascist alliance name). Codenamed Operation Sunset Liberation, millions of Anahuaca and Tsalagi troops have begun preparing to cross the Atlantic."
 tesb_MEX.10.a:0 "From the land of the sunset, freedom calls!"
 tesb_MEX.11.t:0 "Anahuac Fight for African Liberation"
 tesb_MEX.11.desc:0 "Anahuac has made clear its stance on African decolonization and calls on all those with colonial possessions to begin the process of restoring local rule. While Tenochtitlan insists that it is willing to negotiate with colonizers about the terms of a peaceful decolonization process, it has not ruled out armed intervention to end oppressive colonial rule wherever it may be."
 tesb_MEX.11.a:0 "Interesting."
 tesb_MEX.12.t:0 "The Torch of Anahuaca Liberty"
 tesb_MEX.12.desc:0 "After over a century of darkness, the light of democracy once again shines on Anahuac, and Tenochtitlan is now ready to share it with the rest of the world. The birthplace of New World democracy is disappointed to see the rest of the world descending into dictatorship and tyranny much like that of the old Triple Alliance and the Cipac dynasty. Just as outside countries helped Anahuac restore its democracy, it is now time for Anahuac to do the same for its neighbors."
 tesb_MEX.12.a:0 "The jaguar emerges from the jungle."
 tesb_MEX.13.t:0 "Anahuaca-UTA Treaty of Friendship"
 tesb_MEX.13.desc:0 "In a treaty signed today in the city of Kahokiaki, representatives from Anahuac and the UTA reaffirmed their common commitment to democratic values and membership in the Turtle Alliance. ‘Democracy is the common birthright of all of humanity,’ the Anahuaca foreign minister said, ‘And we will defend it wherever we see it is threatened.’ Many foreign observers believe this is a sign that Anahuac will be more proactive on the international stage moving forward."
 tesb_MEX.13.a:0 "The Tsalagi will still take the lead, won’t they?"
 tesb_MEX.14.t:0 "The Northwestern Altepetls Question Settled"
 tesb_MEX.14.desc:0 "The UTA’s ownership of its western regions has long been disputed by the Cipac regime over the last few decades due to being taken in various wars between the two countries. Now that democracy has returned to Anahuac, the question has resurfaced. However, to bury the hatchet, the new Anahuaca government has agreed to recognize the UTA’s claim, renouncing its own following local plebiscites which affirmed the locals’ desire to remain with the UTA."
 tesb_MEX.14.a:0 "The jaguar and panther really do get along."
 tesb_MEX.15.t:0 "Anahuac Calls for Tawantinsuyu’s Democratization"
 tesb_MEX.15.desc:0 "In line with its new outward-looking stance, the Anahuaca government has issued a formal complaint about the lack of democratic freedoms in Tawantinsuyu, a fellow Turtle Alliance member. This provoked an angry response from the Tawantinsuyuan government, which demanded that Anahuac stay out of its affairs. The UTA has remained neutral for now, waiting to see where the chips fall before taking a side."
 tesb_MEX.15.a:0 "Guess the Turtle Alliance isn’t as allied as we thought."
 tesb_MEX.16.t:0 "Anahuac Supports Hawaiian Independence"
 tesb_MEX.16.desc_1:0 "In a surprising move, the Anahuaca government has put forward a proposal to the Tsalagi government to grant independence to the islands of Hawaii. Although they had been integrated into the UTA for several decades, the Hawaiian people had shown little common ties with the indigenous peoples of the mainland, leading to the rise of many separatist groups. Following a local plebiscite, the UTA has decided to grant full independence to Hawaii, reorganizing it as a constitutional monarchy in line with both its historical traditions and Anahuaca democratic values."
 tesb_MEX.16.desc_2:0 "In a surprising move, the Anahuaca government has put forward a proposal to the Tsalagi government to grant independence to the islands of Hawaii. Although they had been integrated into the UTA for several decades, the Hawaiian people had shown little common ties with the indigenous peoples of the mainland, leading to the rise of many separatist groups. Following a local plebiscite, the Tsalagi government has decided to grant further autonomy to Hawaii within the UTA, but it ultimately decided against full independence."
 tesb_MEX.16.a:0 "Interesting."
 tesb_MEX.17.t:0 "The Rise of Pindoraman Nationalism"
 tesb_MEX.17.desc:0 "Pindoraman nationalism within England has long been dominated by left-wing revolutionaries and national republican organizations, with democratic movements being pushed to the fringes. The Anahuaca government now aims to correct that, channeling massive amounts of funds and supplies to promising democratic movements with the goal of not only retaking the larger nationalist movement from the ideologues but also toppling the oppressive English government."
 tesb_MEX.17.a:0 "From one jungle to another."
 tesb_MEX.18.t:0 "Anahuaca-Aotearoan Friendship"
 tesb_MEX.18.desc:0 "Anahuac has turned its attention west to Oceania now. An Anahuaca ambassador was recently spotted in Komnenion to encourage friendship between Anahuac and Aotearoa. In a non-binding ceremony, the two nations affirmed their common commitment to democratic values and freedom on both sides of the Pacific. It remains to be seen if this is a one-off event or a sign that Anahuac is pivoting towards Asia."
 tesb_MEX.18.a:0 "An ‘A’ alliance, you could say."
 tesb_MEX.19.t:0 "Legacy of the Anahuaca Revolution"
 tesb_MEX.19.desc:0 "Just a short while ago, Anahuac languished as a third-rate power, hollowed out by generations of Cipac corruption. Now, though, it is a shining beacon of democracy, a patron of democratic movements on both sides of the Atlantic and Pacific, and a major player on the international community. Centuries ago, Anahuac’s revolution inspired the rise of liberal democracy around the world. Though it ultimately wasn’t successful, the ideas of those revolutionaries have reverberated into the future."
 tesb_MEX.19.a:0 "Now, its second revolution might bring about a new era of change."
