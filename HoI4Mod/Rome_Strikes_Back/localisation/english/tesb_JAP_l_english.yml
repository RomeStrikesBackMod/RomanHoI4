 tesb_JAP.1.t:0 "Death of the Japanese Emperor"
 tesb_JAP.1.desc:0 "Shogun Tachibana no Yoshinobu has announced that the reigning Emperor of Japan suddenly passed away yesterday from tuberculosis at the age of 47. However, he had yet to name a successor from one of his teenaged sons, Mutushito and Myōkōgein. As a result, both the imperial court and the bakufu have been thrown into chaos."
 tesb_JAP.1.a:0 "I’m seeing deja vu…"
 tesb_JAP.2.t:0 "The [GetJapanEra] Succession Crisis"
 tesb_JAP.2.desc_1:0 "To prevent a succession crisis, the Shogun has placed his support behind Prince Mutsuhito, who has reformist and restorationist sympathies. However, he has placed many bakufu loyalists in the imperial court to keep the ambitious prince under control, while Myōkōgein was placated with a new noble title and government office."
 tesb_JAP.2.desc_2:0 "To prevent a succession crisis, the Shogun has placed his support behind Prince Myōkōgein, a politically laid back man, despite Myōkōgein’s insistence that Mutsuhito be emperor. Prince Mutsuhito has already begun protesting the decision, but Yoshinobu has placed many of his own supporters in the imperial court to prevent Mutsuhito from gaining more support."
 tesb_JAP.2.a:0 "I sure hope the new peace holds."
 tesb_JAP.3.t_1:0 "The Coronation of Emperor Keio"
 tesb_JAP.3.t_2:0 "The Coronation of Emperor Tenpo"
 tesb_JAP.3.desc_1:0 "The coronation of the new Emperor of Japan took place today in a grand ceremony overseen by Tachibana no Yoshinobu, who knelt before the emperor and pledged to continue leading the nation in his name. The Emperor Keio in return promised to uphold the traditions of the people and the continuation of Japan’s ancient values."
 tesb_JAP.3.desc_2:0 "The coronation of the new Emperor of Japan took place today in a grand ceremony overseen by Tachibana no Yoshinobu, who knelt before the emperor and pledged to continue leading the nation in his name. The Emperor Tenpo in return acknowledged the Tachibanas’ status as shoguns and granted them his official support."
 tesb_JAP.3.a:0 "Lots of coronations happening lately."
 tesb_JAP.4.t:0 "Emperor Keio Marries"
 tesb_JAP.4.desc:0 "Tachibana no Yoshinobu has arranged a marriage between his daughter, Miyako, and the newly crowned Emperor Keio, as a way of cementing the ties between the Tachibana and the imperial clan. It is clear to all, though, that this event is a show of power on the part of the Tachibana, demonstrating that even the imperial house submits to them."
 tesb_JAP.4.a:0 "Congratulations."
 tesb_JAP.5.t:0 "New Fujiwara Leader"
 tesb_JAP.5.desc:0 "After a brief power struggle within the Fujiwara clan, the ambitious Fujiwara no Takeru, lord of Edo, has taken control of the main estate in Hiraizumi and with it the entire clan. Lord Takeru is a firm supporter of the reformist factions within the Japanese government, with rumored ties to both Prince Mutsuhito and the Equality Association."
 tesb_JAP.5.a:0 "Concerning."
 tesb_JAP.6.t:0 "March on Heian Palace"
 tesb_JAP.6.desc:0 "The looming power struggle between Prince Mutsuhito and Tachibana no Yoshinobu has reached its breaking point. After several high-profile skirmishes and incidents involving forces loyal to Tachibana conservatives, the Fujiwara clan, the Equality Association, and imperial restorationists, Yoshinobu sent troops to arrest Mutsuhito at Heian Palace. However, Mutsuhito escaped the Shogun’s men in a significant setback for Yoshinobu."
 tesb_JAP.6.a:0 "This sounds very familiar."
 tesb_JAP.7.t:0 "Mutsuhito Declares Imperial Restoration"
 tesb_JAP.7.desc:0 "With the help of the Fujiwara clan, Prince Mutsuhito and the imperial restorationists have made the Fujiwara city of Edo their temporary capital. There, Mutsuhito declared that the Tachibana had lost the right to rule Japan. He calls on all loyal Japanese to overthrow the shogunate and restore the rightful authority of the Emperor.\n\nThe [GetJapanEra] War has begun."
 tesb_JAP.7.a:0 "This sounds VERY familiar."
 tesb_JAP.7.b:0 "Mutsuhito is a traitor"

 tesb_JAP.8.t:0 "Minamoto no Shigemori"
 tesb_JAP.8.desc:0 "Minamoto no Shigemori is the current head of the Minamoto clan. A veteran samurai commander and political leader, Shigemori has been placed in command of the Tachibana armies. However, his brother Bennosuke has defected to the imperial restorationists."
 tesb_JAP.8.a:0 "A modern samurai, huh?"
 tesb_JAP.9.t:0 "Iwamoto Kanehira"
 tesb_JAP.9.desc:0 "Iwamoto Kanehira has been Minamoto no Shigemori’s closest friend since childhood and a formidable samurai on horseback in his own right. He has been placed in charge of the Tachibana cavalry divisions."
 tesb_JAP.9.a:0 "Okay."
 tesb_JAP.10.t:0 "Taira no Yoritomo"
 tesb_JAP.10.desc:0 "Taira no Yoritomo is the current head of the Taira clan. Another veteran samurai leader, he has vowed to take the Fujiwara cities of Edo and Kamakura and exact vengeance on the traitorous prince who has brought war back to Japan."
 tesb_JAP.10.a:0 "Okay."
 tesb_JAP.11.t:0 "Echoes of the Genpei War"
 tesb_JAP.11.desc:0 "With the heads of the Tachibana, Taira, Minamoto, and Fujiwara all taking to the battlefield, many have drawn comparisons with the Genpei War of eight hundred years ago, where civil war between the four clans led to the end of the Heian period and the rise of the Tachibana Shogunate. It appears the [GetJapanEra] War will bring about similarly sweeping changes in Japanese politics and society."
 tesb_JAP.11.a:0 "This sounds extremely familiar."
 tesb_JAP.12.t:0 "Fujiwara no Tomoe"
 tesb_JAP.12.desc:0 "Fujiwara no Tomoe is the second daughter of Fujiwara no Takeru. Although she was officially ordained as a shrine maiden at the Enoshima Shrine outside Kamakura, Takeru gave her a samurai’s education, much like her brothers and childhood friend Prince Mutsuhito. Upon the outbreak of war, she left the shrine in the hands of her fellow priestesses and made her way to Edo, pledging to be Mutsuhito’s sword against the Tachibana. Many have taken to calling her the second coming of Tomoe Gozen, a female samurai from the Genpei War."
 tesb_JAP.12.a:0 "Perhaps she is Japan’s Saint Ioanna."
 tesb_JAP.13.t:0 "Minamoto no Bennosuke"
 tesb_JAP.13.desc:0 "Minamoto no Bennosuke is the younger brother of Minamoto no Shigemori. Despite his family name, he turned his back on the rest of the clan and pledged his loyalty to Prince Mutsuhito, believing the Tachibana and Minamoto had lost their way. This has sparked much panic within both clans, as Bennosuke has been hailed as the greatest swordsman the Minamotos have produced in centuries. Many have taken to calling him the second coming of Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Miyamoto Musashi."
 tesb_JAP.13.a:0 "Why does he sound so familiar?"
 tesb_JAP.14.t:0 "Saitō Kichinosuke"
 tesb_JAP.14.desc:0 "A former samurai in the armies of the Taira clan, Saitō Kichinosuke deserted during the Karafuto War of 1919 after witnessing how the Shogunate’s brutal no-surrender policy got many fellow samurai killed. For the next 10 years, he preached Buddhism as a wandering monk and defended villages against bandits. In the 1930s, he was recruited into the imperial court as a tutor for Mutsuhito, Myōkōgein, and Fujiwara no Tomoe. With the outbreak of war, he has once again donned the armor of a samurai."
 tesb_JAP.14.a:0 "Sounds straight out of a movie."
 tesb_JAP.15.t:0 "Sakamoto Hajime"
 tesb_JAP.15.desc:0 "Sakamoto Hajime inherited his father Ryoma’s position as leader of the Equality Association chapter in Kyoto. However, like his father he too was brought up in the ways of the samurai. Upon the outbreak of war, he pledged his and the Equalists’ loyalty to Mutsuhito, seeing imperial restoration as one step towards the fulfillment of the movement’s goals of equality and fairness."
 tesb_JAP.15.a:0 "I didn’t think a socialist samurai was possible."
 tesb_JAP.16.t:0 "Equalists Support the Emperor"
 tesb_JAP.16.desc:0 "The Equality Association’s Japanese chapters have all unanimously declared their support for the imperial factions in the [GetJapanEra] War. Having long believed that a strong emperor and an end to the Shogunate would help achieve their goal of leveling Japan’s social classes, leaders such as Sakamoto Hajime called on their members to take up arms and finally bring about the revolution."
 tesb_JAP.16.a:0 "They really are the Theodosians of the east."
 tesb_JAP.161.t:0 "Modern Japanese Cavalry"
 tesb_JAP.161.desc:0 "The Imperial Japanese have begun fielding tank brigades. They have already won several battles this way."
 tesb_JAP.161.a:0 "How will this new cavalry fare?"
 tesb_JAP.17.t:0 "Tanks vs Samurai"
 tesb_JAP.17.desc:0 "In a large scale battle in eastern Kansai, the stark contrast between Japan’s past and future was on full display when imperial tanks slaughtered a massive cavalry charge by Tachibana samurai, suffering no immediate casualties. Yoshinobu immediately ordered the deployment of his own tanks to prevent another debacle from happening, but the damage to Shogunate morale has already set in."
 tesb_JAP.17.a:0 "Did they think they could stab a tank? Are they stupid?"
 tesb_JAP.18.t:0 "The Battle of Ōtsu"
 tesb_JAP.18.desc_1:0 "The decisive showdown between the Minamoto brothers finally happened when their armies clashed in Ōtsu, on the shores of Lake Biwa. There, Bennosuke challenged his older brother to a one-on-one duel. After a fierce clash that lasted an entire day, during which the two armies stopped fighting to watch, Bennosuke finally claimed victory. An honorable man, the victorious Minamoto allowed the enemy army to recover his brother’s body under a flag of truce before resuming the battle."
 tesb_JAP.18.desc_2:0 "The decisive showdown between the Minamoto brothers finally happened when their armies clashed in Ōtsu, on the shores of Lake Biwa. There, Bennosuke challenged his older brother to a one-on-one duel. After a fierce clash that lasted an entire day, during which the two armies stopped fighting to watch, Shigemori miraculously claimed victory when Bennosuke’s foot became mired in mud, leaving him open to a fatal strike. An honorable man, the victorious Minamoto allowed the enemy army to recover his brother’s body under a flag of truce before resuming the battle."
 tesb_JAP.18.a:0 "Truly a battle between legends."
 tesb_JAP.19.t:0 "Yamato Nadeshiko"
 tesb_JAP.19.desc:0 "To the chagrin of many conservatives, Fujiwara no Tomoe’s leadership in this war has inspired many women to similarly take up arms against the Shogun or otherwise help the imperial cause by working in munitions factories. Mutsuhito even composed a lengthy yet somehow still laconic poem hailing her as the ideal Japanese woman, dismissing the conservatives’ complaints."
 tesb_JAP.19.a:0 "Someone’s got a crush."
 tesb_JAP.20.t:0 "Iwamoto Kanehira’s Loyalty"
 tesb_JAP.20.desc:0 "Stories have spread of Iwamoto Kanehira’s loyalty. They say he refuses to retreat so as to not bring shame to Minamoto no Shigemori’s name. Many imperial armies have broken against the solid rock wall that is Kanehira’s defenses. A strong and capable leader, he will not yield to his enemies."
 tesb_JAP.20.a:0 "Iwamoto does include the kanji for rock."
 tesb_JAP.21.t:0 "Equalist Strike in Osaka"
 tesb_JAP.21.desc:0 "The Equality Association, acting on Sakamoto Hajime’s orders, has launched a general strike in Osaka, targeting factories supplying weapons and munitions for the Tachibana war effort. Although the strikers were dispersed and broken up within two days, the Equality Association still sent a powerful message to Yoshinobu, that it could rise up anywhere it wanted."
 tesb_JAP.21.a:0 "He better watch his back."
 tesb_JAP.22.t:0 "Taira no Yoritomo Besieges Edo"
 tesb_JAP.22.desc:0 "Taira no Yoritomo has laid siege to Edo, attempting to not only take the imperial stronghold and crucial trade port back from Prince Mutsuhito but also restore his honor and avenge the insult of losing it. However, Mutsuhito anticipated the offensive and had already evacuated to nearby Kamakura. Days later, Fujiwara reinforcements led by Fujiwara no Tomoe broke the siege of Edo, forcing Yoritomo to retreat in shame."
 tesb_JAP.22.a:0 "That guy can’t catch a break."
 tesb_JAP.23.t:0 "Minamoto’s Ambition"
 tesb_JAP.23.desc:0 "For all of his talk of honor, Minamoto no Shigemori has let his pride from his victory over Bennosuke get to his head. This has caused him to petition Yoshinobu for greater command over all forces from the three pro-Shogunate clans, not just his own Minamoto forces. Taira no Yoritomo has protested this attempted power grab and demands that Yoshinobu not heed his words, promising consequences if he does."
 tesb_JAP.23.a:0 "And so their talk of honor means nothing in the end."
 tesb_JAP.231.a:0 "Taira has our support"
 tesb_JAP.231.b:0 "Minamoto has our support"
 tesb_JAP.24.t:0 "Taira-Minamoto Civil War"
 tesb_JAP.24.desc_1:0 "The Taira and the Minamoto have gone to war with each other following Shogun Yoshinobu’s decision to side with the Taira. Minamoto no Shigemori has now raised his banners in rebellion, vowing to avenge this dishonor and claim what is rightfully his. It appears that the Genpei War has truly returned."
 tesb_JAP.24.desc_2:0 "The Taira and the Minamoto have gone to war with each other following Shogun Yoshinobu’s decision to side with the Minamoto. Taira no Yoritomo has now raised his banners in rebellion, declaring that the Tachibanas have been taken over by the schemers of the Minamoto clan. It appears that the Genpei War has truly returned."

 tesb_JAP.26.t_2:0 "Prince Mutsuhito Triumphant"
 tesb_JAP.26.desc_1:0 "With the fall of both Edo and Kamakura to bakufu loyalists, the Tachibana clan has claimed victory in the [GetJapanEra] War. The armies of the imperial restorationists have fallen apart. The Fujiwara have surrendered in droves. Lord Takeru was killed during the Battle of Kamakura, while Tomoe fled overseas, and the Equalists retreated to their cities. Prince Mutsuhito has been captured and brought to Kyoto, where Yoshinobu will pass judgment on him."
 tesb_JAP.26.desc_2:0 "The combined forces of the Minamoto, Taira, and Tachibana were not enough to stop the ancient capital of Kyoto from falling to a Fujiwara-Equalist assault. The loss of the capital was the final blow to the Shogunate, which fractured between the three major clans and hundreds of minor clans. Without any organized resistance, imperial forces have swept across the Kansai plain, and soon all under the rising sun will be united."
 tesb_JAP.26.a_1:0 "So much for imperial restoration."
 tesb_JAP.26.a_2:0 "The sun dawns on a new era for Japan."
 tesb_JAP.27.t:0 "Fate of the Tachibana Clan"
 tesb_JAP.27.desc_1:0 "Prince Mutsuhito has declared that the traitorous Tachibana clan, which has been stripped of its powers as shogun, is to be punished severely. Yoshinobu and other senior members are to commit seppuku for the dishonor they brought upon Japan, while the rest of the family is to be exiled. Never again would they wield power in Japan."
 tesb_JAP.27.desc_2:0 "Prince Mutsuhito has declared that the traitorous Tachibana clan, which has been stripped of its powers as shogun, is to be reduced to the ranks of ordinary nobility. In a show of mercy, he refrained from demanding that Yoshinobu and other senior members commit seppuku, instead demanding them relinquish all of their titles and many of their estates. The power vacuum they created would be filled in by the Fujiwara, though Mutsuhito refused to bestow upon them the title of shogun."
 tesb_JAP.27.a:0 "And so ends a thousand years of Tachibana rule."
 tesb_JAP.28.t:0 "Abdication of Emperor Tenpo"
 tesb_JAP.28.desc:0 "Soon after the fall of the Tachibana, the Emperor Tenpo announced his abdication. No longer a pawn of the Tachibana, Myōkōgein made clear his desire to renounce politics and retire to a Buddhist temple, to spend the rest of his life seeking enlightenment. To nobody’s surprise, he named Mutsuhito as his successor."
 tesb_JAP.28.a:0 "I sure hope they don’t have another succession crisis."
 tesb_JAP.29.t:0 "Coronation of Emperor Tenwa"
 tesb_JAP.29.desc:0 "Shortly after the abdication of his brother, Mutsuhito was officially proclaimed Emperor Tenwa, adopting a reign name meaning ‘Heavenly Harmony’, in a ceremony mixing the traditional rites with many elements of a Roman-style coronation, symbolizing his desire to embrace new ways for Japan."
 tesb_JAP.29.a:0 "I’m getting tired of coronations."
 tesb_JAP.30.t:0 "Proclaim Tenwa Restoration"
 tesb_JAP.30.desc:0 "The Emperor Tenwa, borrowing the rhetoric of China’s Hongxu Emperor in 1898, declared that his ascension would mark the beginning of the Tenwa Restoration, in which Japan would take its place among the civilized nations of the world as a modern industrial power, without the bakufu and the shogun to hold it back. To that aim, he has enlisted the aid of both the Fujiwara clan and Equality Association to provide the military, economic, political, and social resources necessary for such a restoration."
 tesb_JAP.30.a:0 "What’s next? Japanocentrism?"
 tesb_JAP.31.t:0 "Marriage of the Tenwa Emperor"
 tesb_JAP.31.desc:0 "The imperial household has announced the marriage between Emperor Tenwa and the war hero Fujiwara no Tomoe, now known as Empress Tomoe, hailing it as a symbol of the new ties between the imperial dynasty and Fujiwara clan. However, the couple insists they married for love, not political reasons."
 tesb_JAP.31.a:0 "We wish them all the best."
 tesb_JAP.32.t:0 "Fujiwara and Ainu Rebellion"
 tesb_JAP.32.desc:0 "Fujiwara and Ainu lords in the northeastern provinces of Japan and the island of Ezo have begun a rebellion against the Tachibana, fearing the erosion of their privileges under a new emperor fully under Yoshinobu’s control."
 tesb_JAP.32.a:0 "Okay."
 tesb_JAP.33.t:0 "Equalist General Strike in Japan"
 tesb_JAP.33.desc:0 "Yoshinobu’s anti-socialist policies have led to massive strikes breaking out in the cities of Edo, Osaka, Kyoto, Yokohama, and Kobe. Led by Sakamoto Hajime, many of these strikers have even organized militias of both workers and sympathetic ronin. The bakufu has begun cracking down on them, but this will likely only further inflame tensions."

 tesb_JAP.34.t:0 "Mutsuhito Speaks Out"
 tesb_JAP.34.desc:0 "Prince Mutsuhito has recently shared his views on the recent succession crisis and the Tachibana clan’s intervention in it. In quite possibly his most confrontational statement to date, he condemned Yoshinobu’s intervention. Although the Shogunate had influenced the imperial succession in the past, Mutsuhito calls on an end to such a practice that places the imperial house in a subordinate role to the Shogun."

The Minamoto clan, long revered for its legendary warriors, pledged to be the sword of the Tachibana, while the Taira clan pledged to be the shield."

 tesb_JAP.38.t:0 "Call up the Samurai"
 tesb_JAP.38.desc:0 "Since the beginning of the bakufu, Japan has been divided up into domains led by military clans. While the Tachibana, Minamoto, Taira, and Fujiwara were the most powerful of these clans, there were hundreds of other ones, each with their own individual loyalties separate from that of the bakufu. So while Tachibana no Yoshinobu has called on all loyal clans to support hiim, there is no guarantee they actually will."
 tesb_JAP.38.a:0 "The empire, long united, must divide."
 tesb_JAP.39.t:0 "Rally the Fujiwara and Equalists"
 tesb_JAP.39.desc:0 "While Yoshinobu could count on two of the major clans as well as his own Tachibana to support him, Mutsuhito only had the Fujiwara as his backers. So instead of focusing his diplomatic efforts on the clans, he reached out to other major factions such as the Equality Association, whose monarcho-socialism and well known opposition to the Shogunate aligned with his own goals. Sakamoto Hajime and his Equalists would become a great boon for both Mutsuhito and Fujiwara no Takeru."

 tesb_JAP.40.desc:0 "Mutsuhito’s call for imperial restoration has resonated significantly with the common people. To them, the last thirty years of the bakufu have only brought destruction and repression. Russian airships had bombed Japanese cities during the Great War, and the shogun’s response was to divert more resources to the military, not the people. It is no wonder that as war returns to Japan, the people have finally given up on the bakufu."

 tesb_JAP.41.desc:0 "Now that the war is over, Yoshinobu has decided to punish the traitorous Fujiwara clan. Although Tomoe escaped overseas, he has ordered the remaining senior leaders to commit seppuku and seized many of the family’s assets and titles, including their main estate in Kyoto. After a thousand years of service to the imperial family, the Fujiwara clan seems poised to disappear into history."

 tesb_JAP.42.desc:0 "Mutsuhito has remained in house arrest since the end of the war, awaiting Yoshinobu’s punishment.

Instead, he ordered the prince banished from Japan, following Lady Fujiwara no Tomoe into exile."
