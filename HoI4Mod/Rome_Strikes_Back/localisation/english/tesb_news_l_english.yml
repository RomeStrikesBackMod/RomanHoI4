In a grand ceremony attended by the major nobility, high-ranking generals, and the highest of temple priests, Zhu Wei was formally acclaimed as the Tianguang Emperor, ruler of All Under Heaven."
 tesb_MNG_news.03.a:0 "An impressive ceremony."
 tesb_MNG_news.04.t:0 "The Caifa Further Ascendant"
 tesb_MNG_news.04.desc:0 "Zhu Wei has made some substantial concessions to the caifa conglomerates that have long dominated the Chinese economy. These include more government subsidies and tax breaks for any caifa that participate in military manufacturing, with further incentives for more efficient production. Furthermore, he has also granted noble titles to the leaders of the most productive caifa."

 tesb_MNG_news.05.t:0 "Grand Secretariat Kang Youwei"
 tesb_MNG_news.05.desc:0 "Zhu Wei has appointed the longtime Equalist politician Kang Youwei as head of the Chinese government, granting him and the Equality Association a mandate to carry out reforms for the betterment of the nation. As the new Grand Secretariat, Kang vows to continue the Equality Association’s mission of equalizing the social classes of China under the Emperor, though the rise of the military class and the caifa has set back the old statesman’s efforts much."

 tesb_MNG_news.06.desc:0 "In an impressive feat of engineering, the Chinese government has recently announced the successful completion of its project to dam the Yangtze River, putting an end to thousands of years of floods affecting the towns and cities along it and providing power to the entire region. However, this came at the cost of flooding several hundred minor villages upriver from the dam."

 tesb_MNG_news.07.desc_caifa:0 "In a solemn ceremony today, Zhu Wei solidified his ties with his caifa allies by marrying Li Meihua, the daughter of Li Xiang, the head of the Li Group, the largest caifa in China. In exchange for demonstrating Zhu Wei’s commitment to patronizing the caifa, Li Xiang’s acceptance of the match shows the submission of the caifa to imperial rule. Many of the traditional nobility protested the emperor’s marrying below his station, but the power of money is not something that can be easily opposed."
 tesb_MNG_news.07.desc_noble:0 "In a solemn ceremony today, Zhu Wei solidified his ties with the traditional nobility and eliminated the only possible threat to his reign by marrying Qian Yangli, the daughter of Qian Hongchang, the self-styled Emperor Yanli of the Wu Dynasty. Although the Wu had long been defeated and reintegrated into the Ming imperial state, there were still many who supported their restoration in opposition to the Ming. However, the marriage has symbolized the Wu’s final submission to the Ming. In return, Zhu Wei bestowed upon the Qian Hongchang and his family the noble title of King of Yue."

 tesb_MNG_news.09.desc:0 "The Chinese government has recently issued a statement demanding that the Miedzymorze Commonwealth withdraw from its colonies in Burma at once, declaring that the presence of European colonizers in Asia will no longer be permitted. It remains to be seen how the supposedly anti-colonialist Miedzymorze will react or if Zhu Wei will turn his attention to other European colonies and their leaders."
 tesb_MNG_news.09.a:0 "How ironic."

 tesb_MNG_news.11.desc:0 "After the past few years of economic reforms, the Chinese economy has overtaken the Hindustani one and the weakened Roman one to become the largest in the world. Propped up with generous subsidies and tax breaks from the government, the caifa now command vast assets of their own across the eastern empire, which they exploit in the service of building the Emperor’s war machine for future conquests."

Invoking the legacy of his grandfather, Zhu Wei promises that the military will be the spearhead through which China reclaims its birthright as the center of the world, leader of humanity."
 tesb_MNG_news.12.a:0 "Concerning."
 tesb_MNG_news.13.t:0 "The Chinese Dragon Awakens"
 tesb_MNG_news.13.desc:0 "The Chinese government’s realignment into a fully Sinocentric regime is complete. Military commanders, nobility, and caifa elite have overlapped so thoroughly with the traditional palace bureaucracy and each other that one can no longer tell the difference between them. All equally kneel before the emperor, who wields supreme power in this ancient empire. With all of the resources of China at his disposal, Zhu Wei is now poised to turn his attention outwards, just as the Hongxu Emperor did decades ago."
 tesb_MNG_news.13.a:0 "We must be ready."

 tesb_MNG_news.14.desc:0 "The Chinese government has just issued a declaration of war to the Russian government.

 tesb_RUS_news.61.desc:0 "It began with a few arrests in the business district of Moscow. Then several major companies were shut down and generals dismissed from their commands. Finally, clique leaders were being rounded off and shot, while their families were sent off to re-education camps in Siberia to become productive citizens of the nation.

 tesb_RUS_news.66.desc:0 "The new communist regime in Russia has taken steps to unify the Third International, or rather wrest control of it from the KRA and its allies. It remains to be seen if these efforts will be successful in light of significant opposition from the social democrats and Longhouseists. In addition, the various left-wing factions within the new Russian regime are still jockeying for power, and a unified government is still being slowly put together."
